# So you want to learn how to code from scratch...
Thats not problem! Cuz I, Akeoott got you covered!

Before I start saying anything... Learning to code is'nt a quick jurney.
- It can take a long time to get *good* at coding. And im not kidding.
- If you acknowledge this fact and your determined to follow this path, be my guest.

<blockquote>
Note: I will cover FULL STACK meaning Frontend and Backend.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This contains a lot more stuff to learn.
</blockquote>

I also want to say that, the way I recomend it may not be the best for every person.<br/>
Everyone has its own interests and preferences. This *tutorial* may or may not be something for you.

# Stage 1
## The first steps to start coding:

Before you can even properally code, you might need something called an **IDE**.<br/>
IDE = Integrated development environment.<br/>
Aka its a **code editor**.

What i recommend is **Visual Studio Code**.<br/>
I personally always use it and it's perfect for me.
