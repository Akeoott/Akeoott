# Hi, I'm AmeðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!<br>
I'm Akeoott, also known as Ame.<br>
This special repository serves as a central hub for my coding journey and projects.

## About Me

- I started my coding adventure on **February 20th, 2025**.<br>
- It's been an incredibly fast-paced and exciting journey since then!<br>
- My first ever "real" project, `GitHub-Activity-Fetcher`.<br>
    - It saw its initial commit on **April 29th, 2025**, marking the beginning of my active development work.

My focus right now is on Python, once I feel that I'm good enough, I want to learn C#.

## My Projects

#### Here are some of the projects I'm actively working on or have completed:

- ### `GitHub-Activity-Fetcher`

    A lightweight Python tool designed to fetch and display GitHub user activity.<br>
    It leverages the GitHub REST API and offers features like rate limit feedback, JSON saving, and a user-friendly GUI.<br>
    This was my very first serious project!

- ### `akeoott-logging-config` (My Custom Logging Library)

    A simple yet robust Python logging configuration library.<br>
    It provides a flexible way to manage logging in applications, allowing for console output, file saving, custom formatting, and even silencing third-party loggers.<br>
    I even use it for my current projects!
